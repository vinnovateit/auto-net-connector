 * Typed status, replacing the Android version which carried pre-resolved

 * Two reasons for the change: the engine has no Compose context to resolve
 * strings in, and the tray needs plain English while the window needs localised
 * resources. The UI maps Step/Reason onto the existing status_* string resources.
 *
 * Also flattens `Connecting` out of the companion object, which in the Android
 * app produced the awkward `ConnectionStatus.Companion.Connecting`.
